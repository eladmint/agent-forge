## 📋 **Content Management Guidelines**

### **📏 Document Length Management**
- **Target Length:** 150-250 entries for operational audit trail
- **Maximum Length:** 300 entries before quarterly archival required
- **Current Length:** ~40 entries ✅ (within operational range)

### **🔄 When to Move Content**

#### **Archive to `docs/implementation/reports/historical/` when:**
- Entry is **over 3 months old** and **no longer operationally relevant**
- Event represents **completed project phases** with **comprehensive outcome documentation**
- Content includes **detailed technical implementations** now **superseded by newer approaches**
- Represents **historical project evolution** rather than **current operational reference**
- **Example:** "Phase 1-2 deployment events after Phase 4 completion"

#### **Keep detailed entries when:**
- Event represents **critical system changes** affecting **current operations**
- Deployment or fix may need **rollback reference** or **troubleshooting context**
- Change affects **infrastructure**, **security**, or **core system behavior**
- Entry includes **performance benchmarks** or **success metrics** for **ongoing optimization**
- **Example:** "Production deployment with performance improvements and configuration details"

#### **Condense to summary when:**
- Multiple related entries can be **combined** into a **single comprehensive summary**
- **Daily granular activities** can be **grouped** into **weekly or monthly summaries**
- **Routine maintenance** or **minor configuration changes** require **less detailed tracking**
- **Development iterations** on same feature can be **consolidated** into **final implementation status**

### **🏗️ Content Migration Process**
1. **Quarterly Review**: Every 3 months, review entries for archival eligibility
2. **Historical Archive**: Move old entries to `docs/implementation/reports/historical/YYYY-QX-changelog-archive.md`
3. **Summary Creation**: Create monthly/quarterly summary entries for condensed information
4. **Reference Preservation**: Ensure critical deployment IDs, build IDs, and service URLs are preserved
