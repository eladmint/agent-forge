> **ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE**  
> The NMKR integration is fully implemented in Agent Forge! See the [NMKRAuditorAgent](../../examples/nmkr_auditor_agent.py) for the complete working implementation.

## Overview of NMKR Studio API

The NMKR Studio API is a comprehensive application programming interface that enables developers to implement all NMKR Studio features programmatically into their own applications or DApps[1]. The API provides the complete functionality offered by NMKR Studio through HTTP GET and POST requests, making it accessible to developers who prefer code-based solutions over user interfaces[1].

### Primary Functions for Asset and NFT Minting

The NMKR Studio API offers several core functionalities for Cardano-based asset creation and management:

**Project and Token Management:**
- Creating and editing NFT projects with customizable metadata templates[2][3]
- Uploading single tokens or bulk uploading files and metadata[2][3]
- Managing token-specific metadata and custom fields[4][5]

**Minting Operations:**
- Manual minting of specific or random tokens from projects[6]
- Minting on demand triggered by customer purchases via NMKR Pay[7]
- Airdropping capabilities for distributing tokens to specific addresses[7]

**Sales and Payment Integration:**
- Setting up NMKR Pay for handling transactions with multiple payment methods[2]
- Creating payment links for random or specific token sales[8]
- Managing sales conditions, whitelists, and pricing structures[2]

**Advanced Features:**
- Support for both CIP-25 and CIP-68 metadata standards[9]
- Royalty management and secondary market integration[7]
- Multi-signature payment options to eliminate sendback fees[10]

NMKR has successfully generated over 1.6 million NFTs and collaborates with major entities including IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation[11]. The platform charges a standard minting fee of 3% or a minimum of 2 ADA per token during minting[10].

## Technical Strategy for Agent Proof-of-Execution NFTs

### Architectural Overview

A robust technical strategy for representing Agent Forge's "Proof-of-Execution" as Cardano NFTs using NMKR would involve a hybrid approach combining on-chain and off-chain storage:

**IPFS Integration for Log Storage:**
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) provides an ideal solution for storing audit log files due to its decentralized nature and content-addressed storage[12][13]. Each log file uploaded to IPFS receives a unique Content Identifier (CID) that serves as a cryptographic hash of the content, ensuring immutability[14][15].

**NFT Metadata Structure:**
The NFT metadata would contain both the IPFS CID and the log's hash, following Cardano's CIP-25 metadata standard[5]. This dual-reference approach provides redundancy and verification capabilities:

```json
{
  "721": {
    "policy_id": {
      "agent_execution_001": {
        "name": "Agent Execution Proof #001",
        "description": "Proof-of-Execution for Agent Forge task completion",
        "image": "ipfs://QmHash.../execution_thumbnail.png",
        "execution_log_cid": "QmExecutionLogHash...",
        "log_hash_sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
        "agent_id": "agent_forge_001",
        "execution_timestamp": "2025-06-14T07:24:00Z",
        "task_type": "data_analysis",
        "completion_status": "success"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Technical Implementation Steps:**

1. **Log File Processing:** Generate the execution log and compute its SHA-256 hash
2. **IPFS Upload:** Store the complete log file on IPFS and obtain the CID[16]
3. **Metadata Preparation:** Create CIP-25 compliant metadata including both IPFS CID and hash
4. **NFT Minting:** Use NMKR API to mint the NFT with custom metadata
5. **Verification System:** Implement verification mechanisms to validate log integrity

This approach leverages IPFS's content-addressed storage where about 50% of stored files are NFT-related, demonstrating its suitability for blockchain applications[17][18].

## NMKR API Examples for Custom Metadata NFT Minting

### Upload NFT with Custom Metadata

The NMKR API provides the `/v2/UploadNft` endpoint for uploading tokens with custom metadata[3]. Here's a specific example of the API request structure:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://studio-api.nmkr.io/v2/UploadNft' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "projectUid": "your_project_uid",
    "tokenname": "agent_execution_001",
    "displayname": "Agent Execution Proof #001",
    "previewImageNft": {
      "mimetype": "image/png",
      "fileFromBase64": "base64_encoded_image_data"
    },
    "metadataPlaceholder": {
      "execution_log_cid": "QmExecutionLogHash...",
      "log_hash_sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
      "agent_id": "agent_forge_001",
      "task_type": "data_analysis"
    }
  }'
```

### Manual Minting Example

For minting and sending tokens to specific addresses, the API provides dedicated endpoints[6]:

```bash
# Mint random token
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://studio-api.nmkr.io/v2/MintAndSendRandom/{projectUid}/{count}/{receiveraddress}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'

# Mint specific token  
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://studio-api.nmkr.io/v2/MintAndSendSpecific/{projectUid}/{nftUid}/{count}/{receiveraddress}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Real-World Implementation Reference

The Snekkies project demonstrates practical API usage for high-demand NFT launches[8]:

```bash
# Check sale conditions
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://studio-api.nmkr.io/v2/CheckIfSaleConditionsMet/{project_UID}/{address_to_check}/{count_NFTs_to_mint}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'

# Get payment address
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://studio-api.nmkr.io/v2/GetPaymentAddressForRandomNftSale/{project_UID}/1?addresstype=Enterprise&blockchain=Cardano' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Transaction Costs and Processing Times

### NMKR Pricing Structure

**Minting Costs:**
- Standard minting fee: 3% or minimum 2 ADA per token[10]
- Mint Coupon cost: 4.5 ADA total per token (includes 2 ADA NMKR fee, 2 ADA MinUtxo, 0.2-0.7 ADA network fee)[19]
- Using Multi-Sig payment eliminates the 2 ADA sendback fee requirement[10]

**Network Fees:**
- Cardano network fees range from 0.2 to 0.7 ADA depending on transaction size and metadata complexity[10][20]
- Minimum transaction fee on Cardano: approximately 0.16 ADA[21]
- Multiple NFTs can be minted in a single transaction, reducing per-token costs significantly[22]

### Processing Times

**Cardano Network Performance:**
- Average block time: 20 seconds, though blocks can be produced at shorter intervals[23]
- Transaction confirmation typically occurs within 20 seconds to a few minutes[23]
- For high assurance, major exchanges require 15 confirmations (approximately 10 minutes)[24]

**NMKR Processing:**
- Minting jobs are processed in batches through a queue system[6]
- Token processing typically completes within "the next few moments" according to documentation[6]
- API responses provide immediate confirmation of job queuing with status tracking capabilities[6]

The cost-effectiveness is particularly notable when compared to other blockchains - Cardano has 37.5-70 times lower fees than Ethereum[21].

## NFT-Based Reputation System for Agents

### Building Agent Portfolios

An NFT-based audit trail can create a comprehensive reputation system where agents accumulate verifiable proof of completed work on-chain[25][26]. Each Proof-of-Execution NFT serves as an immutable record of successful task completion, creating a transparent portfolio that potential clients can verify independently[27][28].

### Reputation Mechanisms

**Blockchain-Based Trust Systems:**
Research demonstrates that blockchain technology can effectively support reputation systems through transparency, immutability, and traceability[25][29]. The integration of smart contracts enables automated reputation scoring based on completion rates, task complexity, and client satisfaction[26][30].

**Multi-Agent Reputation Tracking:**
Studies show that blockchain-based multi-agent systems can track reputation changes after every interaction, storing reputation values and service evaluations on an immutable distributed ledger[26][29]. This approach eliminates single points of failure while providing transparency and accountability[29].

### Implementation Strategy

**Portfolio Development:**
- **Task Categorization:** NFTs can include metadata identifying task types (data analysis, content generation, automation)[31][30]
- **Skill Verification:** Integration with decentralized skills verification systems to validate agent capabilities[31][30]
- **Performance Metrics:** On-chain storage of success rates, completion times, and quality scores[30]

**Reputation Scoring:**
- **Cumulative Reputation:** Agents build reputation through consistent successful task completion[32][33]
- **Cross-Industry Portability:** Reputation scores can transfer across different platforms and use cases[33][31]
- **Stake-Based Validation:** Implementation of economic incentives where reputation validators stake tokens on accuracy[25][34]

**Economic Incentives:**
The system can incorporate monetized reputation mechanisms where higher-reputation agents command premium pricing for their services[35]. This creates economic incentives for agents to maintain high performance standards and builds a sustainable ecosystem for autonomous work verification[25][32].

This approach transforms traditional centralized reputation systems into decentralized, verifiable credentials that agents can leverage across multiple platforms and clients, creating a new paradigm for digital trust and verification[32][33].
