üíª Tech Stack & Tools
You are free to use any AI framework. If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration or structure, consider exploring multi-agent tools like Crew AI, which can help you organize and deploy agent-based workflows effectively.

Remember, your agents don‚Äôt need to be overly complex. They just need to provide clear value for users.
