## üîß **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**

### **Pre-Demo Diagnostics**

#### **Environment Check**
```bash
# Verify Python version
python --version
# Should show Python 3.8+

# Check current directory
pwd
# Should be: /Users/eladm/Projects/token/tokenhunter/agent_forge

# Verify demo file exists
ls -la simple_hackathon_demo.py

# Test imports
python -c "import rich; print('Rich library OK')"
python -c "import asyncio; print('Asyncio OK')"
```

#### **Quick Demo Test**
```bash
# 5-second verification run
timeout 10 python simple_hackathon_demo.py
# Should start and show title screen
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: ModuleNotFoundError**

**Error Message:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich'
```

**Immediate Solutions:**

**Option A: Install Missing Dependency**
```bash

python simple_hackathon_demo.py
```

**Option B: Use Basic Demo (No Dependencies)**
```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
import time

async def basic_demo():
    print('üöÄ AGENT FORGE DEMO - Berlin Blockchain Week 2025')
    print('=' * 60)
    
    print('\n‚ùå ENTERPRISE AI TRUST PROBLEM:')
    print('‚Ä¢ $2.3T decisions rely on unverifiable AI')

asyncio.run(basic_demo())
"
```

**Option C: Use Alternative Demo File**
```bash
python live_presentation_demo.py
# or
python hackathon_demo_setup.py
```

#### **Issue 2: Permission Denied**

**Error Message:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x simple_hackathon_demo.py

# Alternative execution
python3 simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If still failing, copy to home directory
cp simple_hackathon_demo.py ~/demo.py
cd ~
python demo.py
```

#### **Issue 3: File Not Found**

**Error Message:**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to correct directory
cd /Users/eladm/Projects/token/tokenhunter/agent_forge

# Verify location
find . -name "simple_hackathon_demo.py"

# If file missing, use alternative
python live_presentation_demo.py
```

#### **Issue 4: Demo Runs But Output Corrupted**

**Symptoms:** Garbled text, missing formatting, broken tables

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear terminal and retry
clear
python simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If still broken, use plain text version
python -c "
print('AGENT FORGE - Enterprise AI + Blockchain Verification')
print('Problem: 2.3T enterprise AI trust crisis')
print('Solution: Blockchain-verified intelligence via NMKR')
print('Demo: 25+ companies detected, 87% confidence')
print('Value: 95% cost savings, 99% faster processing')
print('Blockchain: Immutable proof on Cardano')
print('Masumi Fit: Autonomous agents + money handling + provable execution')
print('Vote Agent Forge for Masumi Track!')
"
```

#### **Issue 5: Demo Hangs or Freezes**

**Symptoms:** Demo starts but stops responding

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill the process
Ctrl+C

# Quick restart
python simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If persistent, use timeout
timeout 30 python simple_hackathon_demo.py
```

#### **Issue 6: Internet Connection Issues**

**Symptoms:** Network-related errors (shouldn't occur in demo mode)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Demo mode doesn't require internet
# If seeing network errors, it's not our demo
# Proceed with offline demo

python simple_hackathon_demo.py
# Should work without internet connection
```

## üì± **Backup Presentation Options**

### **Option 1: Manual Walkthrough (No Code)**

**Use if all technical options fail:**

*"Let me walk you through our live demo results..."*

> **üìã For complete manual presentation script, see [Presentation Guide](PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md)**  
> **üèóÔ∏è For technical talking points, reference [Technical Architecture](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

#### **Step 1: Problem Statement (30 seconds)**
*"We're solving the $2.3T enterprise AI trust problem. 67% of executives refuse to use AI for critical decisions because there's no proof of execution - it's a complete black box."*

#### **Step 2: Solution Demo (60 seconds)**
*"Our Visual Intelligence Agent just analyzed Berlin Blockchain Week photos and detected 25+ companies across 6 sponsor tiers, identified key executives including Charles Hoskinson and Frederik Gregaard, and generated competitive intelligence with 87% confidence - all in 45 seconds."*

#### **Step 3: Blockchain Verification (30 seconds)**
*"Every result gets an immutable proof on Cardano via NMKR. Transaction ID, policy ID, CIP-25 metadata - complete audit trail for enterprise compliance."*

#### **Step 4: Business Value (45 seconds)**
*"This saves enterprises $5,700 per analysis - 95% cost reduction. $6,000 manual process becomes $300 automated analysis. 40 hours becomes 45 seconds. We're targeting a $14-16B market where 70% of enterprises are actively seeking AI verification."*

#### **Step 5: Masumi Fit (15 seconds)**
*"Perfect Masumi Track fit: autonomous agents working independently, smart contract money handling, and provable execution through blockchain verification."*

### **Option 2: Phone/Tablet Backup**

**Pre-record demo video on phone showing:**
1. Terminal execution of demo
2. Rich console output with tables
3. Business value display
4. Final call to action

**Presentation Script:**
*"I have a pre-recorded version of our live demo here..."* [Show phone screen]

### **Option 3: Slide Deck Backup**

**Create minimal slide deck with:**

**Slide 1: Problem**
- $2.3T enterprise AI trust crisis
- 67% executives don't trust AI
- "Black box" problem

**Slide 2: Solution**
- Blockchain-verified enterprise AI
- NMKR integration on Cardano
- Complete audit trails

**Slide 3: Demo Results**
- 25+ companies detected
- 87% confidence score
- 45-second processing

**Slide 4: Business Value**
- 95% cost savings
- $14-16B market
- Enterprise validation

**Slide 5: Masumi Track**
- Autonomous agents ‚úÖ
- Money handling ‚úÖ
- Provable execution ‚úÖ

**Slide 6: Call to Action**
- Vote Agent Forge
- team@agentforge.ai
- Cardano enterprise future

### **Option 4: Interactive Demonstration**

**If no screen available, use verbal interactive demo:**

*"Imagine I'm showing you a terminal screen right now..."*

**Engage audience:**
- *"Who here has analyzed conference data manually?"*
- *"What would 95% cost savings mean to your business?"*
- *"How valuable would blockchain-verified AI audit trails be?"*

## üéØ **Recovery Strategies During Presentation**

### **Technical Failure - Keep Momentum**

**If demo fails during presentation:**

1. **Immediate acknowledgment:** *"Technology demos - gotta love them!"*
2. **Confident pivot:** *"Let me show you what you would see..."*
3. **Value focus:** *"The real story here is the business value..."*
4. **Strong finish:** *"This is why we're building the future of enterprise AI"*

### **Audience Losing Interest - Re-engage**

**Signs:** Looking at phones, talking, distracted

**Recovery tactics:**
- **Ask direct question:** *"How many have lost money on bad AI decisions?"*
- **Share shocking stat:** *"$2.3 trillion - that's the size of this problem"*
- **Personal connection:** *"This affects every business in this room"*
- **Urgency:** *"Enterprises are ready to pay for this solution right now"*

### **Running Out of Time - Prioritize**

**If presentation time is short:**

1. **Skip demo:** Go straight to business value
2. **Core message:** *"Blockchain-verified enterprise AI solving trillion-dollar trust problem"*
3. **Masumi fit:** *"Autonomous agents, money handling, provable execution"*
4. **Strong ask:** *"Vote Agent Forge - we're the future of enterprise AI"*

### **Judges Seem Skeptical - Build Credibility**

**Address skepticism directly:**
- **Technical depth:** *"This is built on production Agent Forge framework"*
- **Customer validation:** *"Fortune 500 enterprises are already interested"*
- **Market proof:** *"70% actively seeking AI verification solutions"*
- **Ecosystem value:** *"This makes Cardano the enterprise blockchain"*

### **If Everything Fails**

**Last resort - passionate manual presentation:**

*"Judges, let me tell you why Agent Forge deserves the Masumi Track. We're solving the biggest problem in enterprise AI - trust. $2.3 trillion in decisions rely on black box AI that executives don't trust. We've built the first blockchain-verified enterprise AI platform using NMKR on Cardano. Our customers save 95% on analysis costs while getting complete audit trails. We have autonomous agents, smart contract billing, and provable execution - perfect Masumi Track fit. Vote Agent Forge because we're not just building another AI tool - we're building the trust infrastructure that makes enterprise AI adoption possible. This is how Cardano becomes the enterprise blockchain of choice."*

**30 seconds. Clear message. Confident delivery. Win the track.**
