"
```

**Option C: Use Alternative Demo File**
```bash
python live_presentation_demo.py
# or
python hackathon_demo_setup.py
```

#### **Issue 2: Permission Denied**

**Error Message:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x simple_hackathon_demo.py

# Alternative execution
python3 simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If still failing, copy to home directory
cp simple_hackathon_demo.py ~/demo.py
cd ~
python demo.py
```

#### **Issue 3: File Not Found**

**Error Message:**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to correct directory
cd /Users/eladm/Projects/token/tokenhunter/agent_forge

# Verify location
find . -name "simple_hackathon_demo.py"

# If file missing, use alternative
python live_presentation_demo.py
```

#### **Issue 4: Demo Runs But Output Corrupted**

**Symptoms:** Garbled text, missing formatting, broken tables

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear terminal and retry
clear
python simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If still broken, use plain text version
python -c "
print('AGENT FORGE - Enterprise AI + Blockchain Verification')
print('Problem: 2.3T enterprise AI trust crisis')
print('Solution: Blockchain-verified intelligence via NMKR')
print('Demo: 25+ companies detected, 87% confidence')

```

#### **Issue 5: Demo Hangs or Freezes**

**Symptoms:** Demo starts but stops responding

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill the process
Ctrl+C

# Quick restart
python simple_hackathon_demo.py

# If persistent, use timeout
timeout 30 python simple_hackathon_demo.py
```

#### **Issue 6: Internet Connection Issues**

**Symptoms:** Network-related errors (shouldn't occur in demo mode)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Demo mode doesn't require internet
# If seeing network errors, it's not our demo
# Proceed with offline demo

python simple_hackathon_demo.py
# Should work without internet connection
```

## 📱 **Backup Presentation Options**

### **Option 1: Manual Walkthrough (No Code)**

**Use if all technical options fail:**

*"Let me walk you through our live demo results..."*

> **📋 For complete manual presentation script, see [Presentation Guide](PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md)**  
> **🏗️ For technical talking points, reference [Technical Architecture](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

#### **Step 1: Problem Statement (30 seconds)**
*"We're solving the $2.3T enterprise AI trust problem. 67% of executives refuse to use AI for critical decisions because there's no proof of execution - it's a complete black box."*

#### **Step 2: Solution Demo (60 seconds)**
*"Our Visual Intelligence Agent just analyzed Berlin Blockchain Week photos and detected 25+ companies across 6 sponsor tiers, identified key executives including Charles Hoskinson and Frederik Gregaard, and generated competitive intelligence with 87% confidence - all in 45 seconds."*

#### **Step 3: Blockchain Verification (30 seconds)**
*"Every result gets an immutable proof on Cardano via NMKR. Transaction ID, policy ID, CIP-25 metadata - complete audit trail for enterprise compliance."*

#### **Step 4: Business Value (45 seconds)**
*"This saves enterprises $5,700 per analysis - 95% cost reduction. $6,000 manual process becomes $300 automated analysis. 40 hours becomes 45 seconds. We're targeting a $14-16B market where 70% of enterprises are actively seeking AI verification."*

#### **Step 5: Masumi Fit (15 seconds)**
