**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Deciders**: Agent Forge Business & Technical Team  
**Technical Story**: Commercial Strategy for Open Core Model

## Context and Problem Statement

Following the decision to adopt an open core model (ADR-001), we need to define the specific monetization tiers, pricing strategy, and premium marketplace structure. This includes determining what features belong in each tier, how to price them competitively, and how to implement a sustainable revenue model that funds continued development.

## Decision Drivers

- **Market Research**: Industry conversion rates (3-4% freemium to paid)
- **Competitive Pricing**: LangChain (services), CrewAI ($99/month), Hugging Face ($70M ARR)
- **Value Proposition**: Clear value differentiation between tiers
- **Implementation Complexity**: Technical feasibility of tier enforcement
- **Revenue Goals**: Target $50K ARR Year 1, $250K Year 2, $1M Year 3
- **Community Balance**: Maintain community trust while building sustainable business

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Simple Two-Tier Model
- **Free Tier**: Core framework + basic examples
- **Premium Tier**: Advanced examples + enterprise features ($99-299/month)

### Option 2: Multi-Tier SaaS Model
- **Community**: Free core framework
- **Professional**: $99/month premium examples + support
- **Enterprise**: $999/month hosted services + custom features
- **Strategic**: Custom pricing for partnerships

### Option 3: Marketplace + Services Model
- **Framework**: Always free and open source
- **Marketplace**: Premium examples and templates ($10-100 each)
