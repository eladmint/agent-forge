# ADR-006: Release Timeline and Phased Rollout Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Deciders**: Agent Forge Release Team  
**Technical Story**: Open Source Launch Timeline and Risk Management

## Context and Problem Statement

Agent Forge requires a structured release timeline that balances speed-to-market with quality assurance, legal compliance, and community building. Based on industry best practices for open source AI framework launches, we need to define a phased approach that minimizes risk while maximizing adoption potential.

## Decision Drivers

- **Market Timing**: AI framework space is rapidly evolving with new entrants
- **Quality Assurance**: 100% validated components must be maintained through release
- **Legal Compliance**: Proper licensing, attribution, and security reviews required
- **Community Building**: Need early adopters and feedback before public launch
- **Resource Constraints**: Small team requires realistic timeline and scope
- **Risk Management**: Phased approach to identify and address issues early

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Big Bang Release (4 weeks)
- Complete everything simultaneously
- Single major announcement and launch
- Full feature set available from day one

### Option 2: Phased Rollout (12 weeks)
- Beta phase with select developers
- Gradual feature rollout and community building
- Multiple announcement moments

### Option 3: Soft Launch (8 weeks)
- Limited initial release
- Gradual scaling based on feedback
- Conservative approach with expansion

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Phased Rollout (12 weeks) - Option 2**
