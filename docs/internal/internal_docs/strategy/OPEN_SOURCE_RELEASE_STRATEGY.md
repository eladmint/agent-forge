# Agent Forge Open Source Release Strategy

**Document Type:** Internal Strategy Document  
**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Confidentiality:** Internal Use Only

## Executive Summary

Agent Forge is positioned for open source release as a production-ready Python framework for AI web agents with browser automation capabilities. Based on competitive analysis and industry best practices, we recommend an **Open Core** strategy that releases the foundational framework while monetizing premium examples, enterprise services, and hosted solutions.

## Strategic Decision Framework

### Core vs Premium Component Analysis

#### **OPEN SOURCE (Core Framework + MCP Integration)**
- ✅ **BaseAgent Foundation**: Core agent architecture and async patterns
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Security validation and settings framework  
- ✅ **Steel Browser Integration**: Reference implementation and integration layer
- ✅ **FastMCP Integration**: Complete MCP server and auto-discovery system
- ✅ **Claude Desktop Setup**: Full documentation and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ **Basic Agent Examples**: 8+ production-ready agents accessible via MCP
- ✅ **Basic Documentation**: Getting started guides and API reference
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Core testing utilities and validation tools

**Rationale**: MCP integration as distribution channel drives massive adoption. Network effects from open MCP access create larger community for premium conversions. Real competitive advantages are blockchain integration and agent quality, not MCP wrapper.

#### **PREMIUM/COMMERCIAL**
- 💰 **Premium Agent Templates**: Advanced blockchain, AI, and automation agents
- 💰 **Hosted MCP Services**: Managed Claude Desktop integration and scaling
- 💰 **Enterprise Features**: Advanced monitoring, compliance tooling, multi-tenancy
- 💰 **Blockchain Services**: NMKR Proof-of-Execution and Masumi Network monetization
- 💰 **Professional Services**: Custom development, training, consulting
- 💰 **Premium Support**: SLA-backed support, priority bug fixes

**Rationale**: Focus monetization on high-value services and content rather than access barriers. MCP drives volume for premium conversion.

## Steel Browser Integration Strategy

### **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Fork with Attribution**

Based on technical analysis and legal considerations:

1. **Fork Steel Browser Repository**
   - Create `agent-forge/steel-browser-enhanced` fork
   - Maintain clear attribution to original project
   - Document all modifications in CHANGELOG

2. **Customization Management**
   - Version our modifications separately from upstream
   - Periodically sync critical security updates from upstream
   - Maintain compatibility layer for users preferring original Steel Browser

3. **Legal Compliance**
   - Ensure full compliance with Steel Browser's licensing terms
   - Provide clear attribution in documentation and code
   - Consider contributing improvements back to upstream when beneficial

**Alternative Considered**: Reference original repo, but our significant customizations make this impractical for user experience.

## Monetization Model

### **Multi-Tier Revenue Strategy**

Based on research showing successful open core companies achieve $100M+ ARR:

#### **Tier 1: Community (Free)**
- Core framework
- Basic examples
- Community support
- MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing

#### **Tier 2: Professional ($99-299/month)**
- Premium example library
- Advanced documentation
- Email support
- Commercial license options

#### **Tier 3: Enterprise ($999-2999/month)**
- Hosted services
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit trails, compliance)
- SLA-backed support
- Custom development hours

#### **Tier 4: Strategic Partnerships**
- Custom integration development
- Joint go-to-market initiatives
- Revenue sharing arrangements
- Enterprise consulting engagements

### **Revenue Projections**

Conservative estimates based on industry benchmarks:
- **Year 1**: $50K ARR (focus on adoption)
- **Year 2**: $250K ARR (freemium conversion ~3%)
- **Year 3**: $1M ARR (enterprise traction)
