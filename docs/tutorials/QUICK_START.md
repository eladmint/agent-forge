## üé® **Option A: Visual Intelligence Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Prepare Sample Data (2 minutes)**

We'll analyze a sample technology conference for competitive intelligence.

**Sample Conference Photos:**
```
Sample images included in: /examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/
- main_stage.jpg (keynote backdrop with sponsor logos)
- expo_hall.jpg (exhibition floor with booths)
- sponsor_wall.jpg (sponsor recognition wall)
```

### **Step 2: Run Visual Intelligence Analysis (3 minutes)**

**Claude Desktop Usage:**
```
Claude, use visual_intelligence to analyze the sample conference photos in /examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/ and identify all company logos with their sponsorship tiers
```

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python cli.py run visual_intelligence \
  --image-urls "/examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/*.jpg" \
  --industry technology \
  --output-format json
```

**Python Script:**
```python
from agent_forge.examples.visual_intelligence_agent import VisualIntelligenceAgent

async def quick_analysis():
    agent = VisualIntelligenceAgent()
    await agent.initialize()
    
    results = await agent.run_competitive_intelligence(
        image_urls=[
            "/examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/main_stage.jpg",
            "/examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/expo_hall.jpg",
            "/examples/sample_data/tech_conference_2024/sponsor_wall.jpg"
        ],
        target_industry="technology"
    )
    
    print(f"Found {len(results['brands'])} companies")
    print(f"Executive intelligence: {len(results['executives'])} leaders identified")
    return results

# Run the analysis
import asyncio
results = asyncio.run(quick_analysis())
```

### **Step 3: Review Results (5 minutes)**

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": {
    "total_brands_detected": 12,
    "confidence_score": 0.87,
    "processing_time": "45 seconds"
  },
  "brands": [
    {
      "name": "Microsoft",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "tier": "title",
      "context": "Title sponsor with dominant main stage presence",

## üìö **Option B: Research Compiler Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Prepare Research Data (2 minutes)**

We'll compile a market research report for a fictional SaaS company acquisition.

**Sample Research Data:**
```python
sample_research_data = [
    {
        "key": "Company Overview",
        "value": "TechFlow SaaS - B2B workflow automation platform",
        "source": {"url": "company-website.com", "type": "primary"},
        "timestamp": "2024-06-14"
    },
    {
        "key": "Annual Revenue", 
        "value": "$45M ARR with 35% YoY growth",
        "source": {"url": "investor-update.pdf", "type": "financial"},
        "timestamp": "2024-06-01"
    },
    {
        "key": "Market Position",
        "value": "Top 3 in mid-market workflow automation",
        "source": {"url": "gartner-report-2024.pdf", "type": "analyst"},
        "timestamp": "2024-05-15"
    },
    {
        "key": "Customer Base",
        "value": "500+ enterprise customers, 95% retention rate",
        "source": {"url": "earnings-call-q2.mp3", "type": "financial"},
        "timestamp": "2024-06-10"
    }
]
```

### **Step 2: Run Research Compilation (3 minutes)**

**Claude Desktop Usage:**
```
Claude, use research_compiler to compile an M&A due diligence report for TechFlow SaaS using the sample research data I'll provide
```

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python cli.py run research_compiler \
  --research-type ma_due_diligence \
  --target-entity "TechFlow SaaS" \
  --data-file "/examples/sample_data/techflow_research.json"
```

**Python Script:**
```python
from agent_forge.examples.research_compiler_agent import ResearchCompilerAgent, ResearchType

async def quick_research():
    agent = ResearchCompilerAgent()
    await agent.initialize()
    
    report = await agent.compile_research(
        raw_data=sample_research_data,
        research_type=ResearchType.MA_DUE_DILIGENCE,
        target_entity="TechFlow SaaS"
    )
    
    print(f"Generated {len(report.sections)} report sections")
    print(f"Quality score: {report.data_quality_score}")
    return report

# Run the analysis
import asyncio
report = asyncio.run(quick_research())
```

### **Step 3: Review Results (5 minutes)**
