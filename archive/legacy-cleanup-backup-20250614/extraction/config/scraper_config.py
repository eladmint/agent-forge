"""Configuration for EventDataExtractorAgent and Production Scraper System.

This module stores CSS selectors, model configurations, and other parameters used for 
scraping event data, primarily from Luma.co event pages. Storing these externally 
allows for easier updates without modifying the agent's core logic.

The configurations are organized into dictionaries corresponding to different
extraction tasks or methods within the agent.

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE: Direct Orchestration with Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Status: Production Ready
- Model: gemini-2.0-flash-001 via Vertex AI
- Capabilities: Multimodal (text + image analysis)
- Performance: 11s for comprehensive extraction, 100% target detection success

# Note: Some selectors, especially those with `jsx-*` class names, are highly specific
# to the current structure of Luma.co pages and may break if Luma redesigns its site.
# Regular review and updates to these selectors might be necessary.

# --- Selectors for `extract_event_info_manually` (fallback function) ---
# These selectors are used when the primary JSON-LD or initial props script
# parsing fails or does not yield all necessary information.

    "initial_props_script": 'script#initial-props[type="application/json"]',  # Luma-specific script containing event data.
    # Fallback selectors if initial_props JSON fails or is incomplete for these fields:
    "location_fallback": ".event-location-class",  # Placeholder: actual class for location if needed.
    "description_fallback_container": ".event-description-class",  # Placeholder: container for event description.
    "organizer_fallback_container": ".event-organizer-class",  # Placeholder: container for organizer info.
    "price_regex": r"(\$|\€|£|Free|Ticket)",  # Regex to find price-related text.
}

# --- Selectors for `_extract_direct_details` (Luma-specific detailed extraction) ---
# These selectors target specific elements within the Luma.co event page structure
# for extracting details like presenter, host, and datetime.

# --- Default values placeholder ---

# strictly necessary here if defaults are handled by the agent loading this config.
# However, it can be useful for testing or understanding the full structure.
