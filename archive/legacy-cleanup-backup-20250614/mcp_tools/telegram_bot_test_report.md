Please verify the following in the screenshots:

1. **Conversational Introduction:** Look for "Here are some events I've found:" instead of "üîç Found X Events"
2. **Event Format:** Each event should show:
   - **Event Name** (bold)
   - ‚è∞ [Date and time]
   - üìç [Location]
   - [One sentence description]
   - üîó [Event Details](link)
3. **Button Count:** Should show maximum 2 buttons, not multiple progressive disclosure buttons
4. **Closing Statement:** Should end with "Would you like to see more details about any of these events?"

## Next Steps

1. Check the bot's response generation logic in `/Users/eladm/Projects/token/tokenhunter/chatbot_telegram/bot.py`
2. Verify the conversation format is properly implemented
3. Test again after any fixes
