## 🏆 Strategic Achievement

We have successfully implemented the **Intelligent Event Conflict Detection System** as requested by the user to create a **unique selling proposition (USP)** for Nuru AI. This system goes far beyond simple time conflict detection to provide **strategic event scheduling optimization** that no other platform offers.

### **Key User Insight Addressed**
> *"Should we limit the users to only register to one event that is happening at the same time? Luma doesn't limit the users like that but this might be an USP of our platform."* - User Request

**Our Solution:** Instead of simply limiting users, we provide **intelligent guidance** that helps users make **strategic decisions** about their event attendance while maintaining their autonomy.
