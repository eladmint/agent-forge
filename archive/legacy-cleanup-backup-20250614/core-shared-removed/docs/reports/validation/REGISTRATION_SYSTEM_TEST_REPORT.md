## 🔧 Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues (2)
1. **Conflict Detection API Endpoint**
   - Issue: Returns 500 Internal Server Error
   - Impact: Web/API users cannot access conflict detection
   - Solution: Debug server-side conflict detection implementation

2. **Registration API Validation**
   - Issue: Missing required `user_id` field in request model
   - Impact: API registrations fail with 422 validation error
   - Solution: Update Pydantic model to include `user_id` field

### Minor Issues (2)
3. **Platform Detection Accuracy**
   - Issue: URL pattern matching needs improvement
   - Impact: May not correctly identify all platform URLs
   - Solution: Enhance regex patterns for platform detection

4. **Ticket Tailor API Key**
   - Issue: Client requires API key for initialization
   - Impact: Ticket Tailor registrations cannot be processed
   - Solution: Configure API key in environment variables

### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Add comprehensive logging** for registration attempts and failures
2. **Implement retry logic** for failed registrations
3. **Add user notification system** for registration status updates
4. **Create registration analytics dashboard** for success rates
5. **Implement automated testing suite** for continuous validation
