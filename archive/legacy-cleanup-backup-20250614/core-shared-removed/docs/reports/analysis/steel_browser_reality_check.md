- **Workaround**: Production orchestrator (needs 0-events bug fix)
- **Future**: Distributed extraction across regions

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Complete Extraction**: Wait for rate limiting to clear, extract remaining 16+ events
2. **Production Orchestrator Debug**: Fix 0-events return issue
3. **Full Database Population**: Save all 108 validated events
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Real-time extraction monitoring

### **Optimization Opportunities**
1. **Multi-Region Distribution**: Use multiple IP addresses for parallel extraction
2. **Session Management**: Implement cookie/session rotation
3. **Fallback Sources**: Add alternative event discovery methods
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous event feed monitoring
