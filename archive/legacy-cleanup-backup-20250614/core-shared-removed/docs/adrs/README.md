## üéØ **Shared Services Architecture Excellence**

### **üîß Infrastructure Foundation**
Our shared services provide the foundational capabilities that enable all other services:

- **Database Layer**: Unified data access patterns with Supabase integration
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, authorization, and security middleware
- **AI Processing**: Shared AI capabilities for search, extraction, and enhancement
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration and environment management

### **üìä Cross-Service Integration**
These ADRs establish patterns used across all services:
- **API Services**: Leverage shared database and security patterns
- **Extraction Services**: Use shared AI processing and search capabilities  
- **Bot Services**: Integrate with shared authentication and user management
- **Monitoring Services**: Built on shared security and configuration foundations

### **üöÄ Platform Benefits**
The shared services architecture provides:
- **Consistency**: Common patterns across all services
- **Efficiency**: Reduced duplication of infrastructure code
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested security and database patterns
- **Scalability**: Shared optimization and performance improvements

## üìà **Implementation Impact**

### **Database Excellence**
