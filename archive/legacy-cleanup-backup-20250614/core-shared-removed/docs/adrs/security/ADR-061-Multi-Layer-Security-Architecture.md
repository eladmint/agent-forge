# ADR-061: Multi-Layer Security Architecture for Web3 AI Agents

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Phase 24+ Web3 AI Agent Security Framework  
**Scope:** Agent Execution Security and Risk Management  

---

## Context

TokenHunter's Web3 AI Agent implementation requires comprehensive security architecture to protect against:

- **Context manipulation attacks** targeting agent decision-making
- **Financial exploitation** through malicious agent behavior  
- **Code injection** and unauthorized agent modification
- **Cross-agent contamination** and system compromise
- **Unauthorized access** to user credentials and assets
- **Regulatory compliance** requirements for financial operations

The security architecture must balance **agent autonomy** with **user protection**, enabling sophisticated AI capabilities while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

## Decision

**Multi-Layer Security Framework**
1. **Hardware Security Layer**: AWS KMS + Nitro Enclaves (TEE)
2. **Execution Isolation Layer**: WebAssembly (Wasm) Sandboxing  
3. **Context Protection Layer**: Input validation and integrity verification
4. **Agent Monitoring Layer**: Real-time behavior analysis and anomaly detection
5. **Economic Security Layer**: Multi-confirmation transactions and automated rollback

**Primary Components:**

### Layer 1: AWS KMS + Nitro Enclaves (Trusted Execution Environment)
- **Hardware-level protection** for sensitive agent operations
- **Cryptographic key management** isolated from main system
- **Attestation and verification** of agent execution environment
- **Secure multi-party computation** for collaborative agents

### Layer 2: WebAssembly Sandboxing
- **Process isolation** for untrusted agent code execution
- **Resource limitations** preventing system resource exhaustion
- **API restrictions** controlling agent system access
- **Near-native performance** with security boundaries

### Layer 3: SandboxAI Integration
- **Specialized agent execution environment** with security controls
- **Full-agency and limited-agency modes** based on risk assessment
- **Dynamic permission management** for agent capabilities
- **Real-time monitoring** and intervention capabilities

### Layer 4: Context Manipulation Protection
- **Advanced input validation** preventing injection attacks
- **Context integrity verification** ensuring authentic agent inputs
- **Semantic analysis** detecting manipulation attempts
- **Source verification** for all agent data inputs

### Layer 5: Financial Transaction Security
- **Multi-confirmation strategy** for value-based security requirements
- **Automated rollback systems** for suspicious transactions
- **Escrow smart contracts** with dispute resolution
- **Risk-based transaction limits** and monitoring

## Rationale

### Security Requirements Analysis:
1. **High-Value Target**: Web3 agents will handle financial transactions and sensitive data
2. **Attack Surface**: Multiple vectors including context manipulation, code injection, economic exploitation
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial operations require enterprise-grade security
4. **User Trust**: Security breaches would undermine agent marketplace adoption
5. **Ecosystem Responsibility**: Security failures affect entire Web3 agent ecosystem

### Multi-Layer Approach Benefits:
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single point of failure
2. **Attack Vector Coverage**: Each layer addresses different attack types
3. **Performance Balance**: Hardware acceleration with software flexibility
4. **Compliance Support**: Meets enterprise and regulatory security requirements
5. **Incident Response**: Multiple detection and response mechanisms

### Technology Selection Rationale:
- **AWS Nitro Enclaves**: Industry-leading TEE with AWS ecosystem integration
- **WebAssembly**: Proven sandboxing technology with performance benefits
- **SandboxAI**: Specialized AI agent security with TokenHunter customization
- **Smart Contract Security**: Blockchain-native protection for financial operations

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Meets highest security standards for financial applications
- **User Protection**: Comprehensive protection against agent-related risks
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Supports compliance with financial regulations
- **Market Confidence**: Strong security enhances marketplace adoption
- **Ecosystem Leadership**: Sets security standards for Web3 agent platforms

### Negative:
- **Implementation Complexity**: Multi-layer architecture requires sophisticated implementation
- **Performance Overhead**: Security layers may impact agent execution speed
- **Operational Costs**: TEE and specialized security infrastructure increases costs
- **Development Complexity**: Security requirements increase development effort

### Risk Assessment:
- **High-Impact Risks Mitigated**: Financial exploitation, system compromise, regulatory violations
- **Residual Risks**: Social engineering, zero-day vulnerabilities, insider threats
- **Risk Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and threat intelligence integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 24 (Q4 2025): Foundation Security
- **AWS KMS + Nitro Enclaves**: TEE implementation for core agent operations
