# ADR-041: Date Processing and Tool Execution Fix

## Status
‚úÖ **ACCEPTED** - Implemented and verified working (2025-05-30)

## Context
The user reported a critical discrepancy between automated deployment test results and actual telegram bot behavior for date processing queries. The bot was failing to process natural language date queries like "tell me about events on april 29 2025" with database errors, despite previous successful test results.

### Problem Description
1. **Date Query Failures**: Telegram bot returned "An internal database error occurred while fetching events for 2025-04-29" for date-based queries
2. **Tool Execution Issues**: LLM was making correct function calls but tools weren't executing
3. **Legacy Code Interference**: Obsolete `event_lookup.py` was still being called despite being deleted locally
4. **Deployment Issues**: Pydantic validation errors preventing new revisions from deploying
5. **Traffic Routing Problems**: Old broken revision receiving traffic instead of fixed revisions

### Investigation Findings
- LLM correctly interpreted dates and made proper function calls
- Tool execution pipeline had a bug in function call detection logic
- Legacy `event_lookup.py` file was calling non-existent `match_calendar_events` database function
- Pydantic models were missing required fields causing validation errors
- Cloud Run traffic was stuck on old revision `v24` instead of latest fixes

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive fix addressing all identified issues:

### 1. Pydantic Model Fixes
**File**: `chatbot_api/core/models.py`
- Added missing `request_id: Optional[str] = None` field to `DebugInfo` model
- Made `processing_time: Optional[float] = None` in `ChatResponse` model (was required but not provided)

### 2. Tool Execution Logic Fix
**File**: `chatbot_api/main.py` (lines 714-755)
```python
# OLD: Only checked parts[0] for function calls
if candidate.content.parts and candidate.content.parts[0].function_call:

# NEW: Iterate through all parts to find function calls
for part in candidate.content.parts:
    if hasattr(part, 'function_call') and part.function_call:
```

**Root Cause**: LLM responses can have multiple parts - text in `parts[0]` and function calls in `parts[1]`. The original code only checked the first part.

### 3. Legacy Code Elimination
**Files Affected**:
- Deleted: `chatbot_api/tools/event_lookup.py` (called non-existent `match_calendar_events`)
- Updated: `chatbot_api/tools/tools.py` to use enhanced date processing from `utils.database.search`
- Added: Docker cache-busting and explicit file removal commands

**Dockerfile Updates**:
```dockerfile
# Explicitly remove legacy files and Python cache to force clean build
RUN find ./chatbot_api -name "event_lookup.py*" -delete || true
RUN find ./chatbot_api -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} + || true
RUN find ./chatbot_api -name "*.pyc" -delete || true
```

### 4. Traffic Routing Fix
**Command**: 
```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic chatbot-api-service-v2 --region=us-central1 --to-revisions=chatbot-api-service-v2-00017-8rp=100
```

**Issue**: Traffic was still routing to old revision `v24` despite successful new deployments.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Date Processing Integration
**File**: `utils/database/search.py`
- Function `_sync_get_events_by_date()` uses enhanced date processing from `utils.ai.date_processing`
- Supports natural language dates: "april 29", "tomorrow", "next week"
- Automatically converts to proper UTC datetime ranges for database queries
- Provides user-friendly error messages and suggestions

### Tool Function Pipeline
**File**: `chatbot_api/tools/tools.py`
- `get_events_by_date()` function properly integrated with enhanced date processing
- Removed dependency on legacy `event_lookup` module
- Added comprehensive error handling and user-friendly responses

### Debug and Monitoring
- Added extensive debug logging to trace function call detection
- Confirmed tool execution pipeline works end-to-end
- Verified database queries use correct enhanced date processing

## Consequences

### ‚úÖ Positive Outcomes
1. **Date Processing Works**: Natural language date queries now return comprehensive event listings
2. **Tool Execution Reliable**: Function calls are properly detected and executed in all response parts
3. **No Legacy Issues**: Eliminated obsolete code paths causing database errors
4. **Stable Deployments**: Pydantic validation errors resolved, deployments work consistently
5. **User Experience**: Rich, formatted responses with emojis and detailed event information

### üìä Test Results
**Before Fix**:
- "tell me about events on april 29 2025" ‚Üí "An internal database error occurred"
- `tool_calls_made: 0`, `tools_used: []`

**After Fix**:
- "tell me about events on april 29 2025" ‚Üí "üìÖ Found 104 events on April 29 2025:" + detailed listings
- `tool_calls_made: 1`, proper tool execution
- User confirmed: Telegram bot UI test successful

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Function Call Detection**: Robust iteration through all response parts
- **Date Processing**: Enhanced natural language support with timezone handling
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages instead of technical database errors
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Cache-busting and explicit legacy file removal
- **Traffic Management**: Proper revision routing for immediate fix deployment

### üìù Documentation Updates
- Comprehensive ADR documenting root causes and solutions
- Debug logging for future troubleshooting
- Clear separation between enhanced and legacy date processing

## Follow-up Actions
1. ‚úÖ Verify telegram bot functionality with various date formats
2. ‚úÖ Monitor Cloud Run logs for any remaining issues
3. ‚úÖ Confirm all tool functions work properly
4. ‚úÖ Test edge cases with invalid dates and error handling

## Notes
This fix resolves a critical user-facing issue where automated tests showed success but real usage failed. The root cause was a combination of legacy code interference, model validation errors, tool execution bugs, and traffic routing problems. The comprehensive fix ensures reliable date processing functionality for the telegram bot.
