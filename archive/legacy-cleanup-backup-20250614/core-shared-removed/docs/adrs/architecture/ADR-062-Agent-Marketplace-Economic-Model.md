# ADR-062: Agent Marketplace Economic Model

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Phase 25+ Agent Marketplace Foundation  
**Scope:** Economic Framework and Payment Infrastructure  

---

## Context

TokenHunter's agent marketplace (Phase 25+) requires a comprehensive economic model that enables:

- **Real-time payment streaming** for ongoing agent services
- **Trustless transactions** between users and agent providers
- **Automated dispute resolution** and escrow mechanisms
- **Multi-token support** for price-stable transactions
- **Cross-chain compatibility** for broad ecosystem participation
- **Economic incentives** for quality agent development and usage

The economic model must balance **user protection**, **provider incentives**, and **platform sustainability** while leveraging blockchain-native capabilities for transparency and automation.

## Decision

**Sablier-Based Streaming Payment Architecture**

### Core Economic Framework:
1. **Sablier Protocol Integration**: Real-time payment streaming for usage-based pricing
2. **Three-Party Escrow System**: User, agent provider, TokenHunter arbiter structure
3. **Multi-Token Support**: DAI, USDC, and major stablecoin integration
4. **Conditional Payment Mechanisms**: Milestone-based payments with performance criteria
5. **Cross-Chain Payment Rails**: Multi-blockchain support for comprehensive coverage

### Payment Infrastructure Components:

#### 1. Streaming Payment System (Sablier Protocol)
```solidity
// Real-time payment streaming for agent services
contract AgentPaymentStream {
    struct StreamConfig {
        address token;           // Payment token (DAI, USDC, etc.)
        uint256 ratePerSecond;  // Streaming rate
        uint256 duration;       // Stream duration
        bool pausable;          // User control capability
    }
}
```

#### 2. Escrow Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Three-party escrow with automated dispute resolution
contract AgentEscrow {
    enum DisputeStatus { None, Raised, Resolved }
    
    struct EscrowAgreement {
        address user;
        address provider;
        address arbiter;        // TokenHunter dispute resolution
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 milestones;
        DisputeStatus status;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Agent Discovery and Payment Integration
- **Smart Contract Agent Registry**: On-chain agent capabilities and pricing
- **Trust Scoring System**: Reputation-based provider rankings
- **Automated Settlement**: Performance-based payment releases
- **Payment Stream Management**: User controls for pausing/adjusting payments

## Rationale

### Economic Requirements Analysis:
1. **Usage-Based Pricing**: Agents provide ongoing services requiring continuous payment
2. **Trust Minimization**: Blockchain-native escrow reduces counterparty risk
3. **Price Stability**: Stablecoin integration prevents payment volatility
4. **Cross-Chain Access**: Multi-blockchain support maximizes user accessibility
5. **Dispute Resolution**: Automated mechanisms reduce transaction costs

### Sablier Protocol Advantages:
1. **Proven Technology**: Battle-tested streaming payment infrastructure
2. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for high-frequency micro-payments
3. **User Control**: Real-time pause/resume capabilities
4. **Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK and documentation
5. **Multi-Token Support**: Native support for major stablecoins

### Three-Party Escrow Benefits:
1. **User Protection**: Funds held until service delivery confirmation
2. **Provider Security**: Guaranteed payment for delivered services
3. **Platform Authority**: TokenHunter arbitration ensures quality standards
4. **Automated Resolution**: Smart contract logic reduces manual intervention
5. **Reputation Integration**: Dispute history affects provider trust scores

## Economic Model Structure

### Payment Tiers and Pricing:
```
Basic Tier:
- Rate: $0.01-0.05 per minute
- Services: Information-only agents
- Payment: Real-time streaming

Premium Tier:
- Rate: $0.10-0.50 per minute  
- Services: Action-oriented agents
- Payment: Milestone-based with streaming

Enterprise Tier:
- Rate: Custom pricing
- Services: Dedicated agent development
- Payment: Hybrid escrow + streaming
```

### Revenue Distribution:
- **Agent Provider**: 70% of payment
- **TokenHunter Platform**: 25% of payment
- **Network Fees**: 5% (gas, cross-chain, etc.)

### Economic Incentives:
1. **Quality Bonuses**: High-rated providers receive payment boosts
2. **Volume Discounts**: Regular users pay reduced platform fees
3. **Developer Rewards**: Open source contributions earn token incentives
4. **Staking Mechanisms**: Token staking for reduced fees and priority access

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Trustless Operations**: Blockchain-native escrow reduces platform risk
- **Real-Time Economics**: Streaming payments enable sophisticated pricing models
- **Cross-Chain Access**: Multi-blockchain support maximizes market reach
- **Automated Operations**: Smart contracts reduce operational overhead
- **Economic Transparency**: On-chain transactions provide full audit trail

### Negative:
- **Gas Cost Exposure**: Blockchain transactions subject to network congestion
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Bugs or exploits could affect payment security
- **Complexity Management**: Multi-chain operations increase technical complexity
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: DeFi payment systems face evolving regulations

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Reduces dependency on single blockchain
- **Contract Auditing**: Professional security audits for all payment contracts
- **Insurance Integration**: DeFi insurance protocols for smart contract protection
- **Compliance Framework**: Legal review and regulatory compliance preparation
